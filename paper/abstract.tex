The memory allocator is a critical component that can impact the performance of an application by orders of magnitude. However, none of existing profilers helps understand the performance and memory impact caused by memory allocators. Therefore, programmers may spend unnecessary effort in investigating applications, even if an  issue is primarily caused by utilizing an inappropriate allocator. This paper designs the first general profiler---\texttt{mmprof}---for different memory allocators, which profiles the performance, memory overhead, scalability, and application-friendliness of a memory allocator. \texttt{mmprof} not only helps programmers identify design issues of an allocator without reinventing the wheels every time, but also benefits normal users by presenting comprehensive metrics of an allocator. Based on our extensive evaluation, \texttt{mmprof} helps identify multiple known and new design issues found in widely-used allocators. 
%Toward this goal, this paper defines a range of metrics useful to the evaluation of an allocator. 
Due to its uniqueness and usefulness, \texttt{mmprof} will be an indispensable complement to existing profilers.
