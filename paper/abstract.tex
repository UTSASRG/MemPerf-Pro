Memory allocator is such an important component that could impact the performance of applications by up to orders of magnitude. However, none of the existing profilers helps understand the behavior of an allocator. Further, programmers may spend unnecessary effort in investigating the application code, even if a performance issue or excessive memory consumption is mainly caused by using an inappropriate allocator. This paper designs the first general profiler---\texttt{mmprof}---for different memory allocators. \texttt{mmprof} profiles the performance, memory overhead, scalability, and application-friendliness of a memory allocator. \texttt{mmprof} not only helps allocator programmers to understand the design issue without designing a custom profiler, but also benefits normal users by explaining whether a performance or memory issue is actually caused by an allocator. Based on our extensive evaluation, \texttt{mmprof} helps identify multiple design issues in widely-used allocators. This paper also provides a range of metrics to evaluate an allocator. Due to its uniqueness and usefulness, \texttt{mmprof} will be an indispensable complementary to existing profilers.
