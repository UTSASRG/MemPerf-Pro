The memory allocator is a critically important component of a system that can impact the performance of applications by orders of magnitude. However, no existing profiler helps understand the behavior of general-purpose heap allocators. Further, programmers may spend unnecessary effort in investigating application code, even if the performance issue or excessive memory consumption is primarily caused by utilizing an inappropriate allocator. This paper designs the first general profiler---\texttt{mmprof}---for different memory allocators. \texttt{mmprof} profiles the performance, memory overhead, scalability, and application-friendliness of a given memory allocator. Thus, \texttt{mmprof} not only helps allocator programmers to better understand potential design issues without designing their own custom profiler, but also benefits normal users by diagnosing whether a performance or memory issue is actually caused by their allocator. Based on our extensive evaluation, \texttt{mmprof} helps identify multiple design issues found in widely-used allocators. Toward this goal, this paper defines a range of metrics useful to the evaluation of an allocator. Due to its uniqueness and usefulness, \texttt{mmprof} will be an indispensable complement to existing profilers.
