\subsection{Understanding Different Allocators}

How to identify the type of allocators? Typically, most allocators only utilize BUMP pointer based allocators or BIBOP-style allocators. 

\subsubsection{Types of Allocators}
BIBOP style is the abbreviation of ``Big Bag of Pages''~\cite{hanson1980}.
For BIBOP-style allocators, one or multiple continuous pages are treated as a ``bag'' that holds objects of the same size class. The metadata of each heap object, such as its size and availability information, is typically stored in a separate area.

Bump pointer
How to collect the size class information?
How to solve the issue when connecting to some allocators, such as Guarder, since Guarder interposes the thread execution. 

How to intercept the memory allocations and deallocations? 

Region-based allocators: 
it is not selected in this study, since we can't find many existing allocators with a high performance.
