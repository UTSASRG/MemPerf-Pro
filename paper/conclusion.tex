\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

It is well established that memory allocation can significantly impact the performance of applications. However, none of the existing profilers help understand the behavior of an allocator, nor do they help diagnose a performance or memory overhead issue caused by the allocator. This paper designs the first general profiler to profile the performance, memory overhead, scalability, and application-friendliness of a memory allocator, through the use of simple counters, timestamp registers, and hardware Performance Monitoring Units. It has the potential to benefit both allocator designers and normal users. Our extensive evaluation has confirmed that \texttt{mmprof} helps identify multiple design issues in widely-used allocators. Therefore, \texttt{mmprof} is an indispensable complement to existing profilers.
