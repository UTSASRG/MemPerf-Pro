This library utilizes the syscall_intercept library to intercept madvise system calls
performed by glibc.

The required header file libsyscall_intercept_hook_point.h is located in /usr/include
on both SRG1 and SRG2 machines. If missing or running on an external machine you must download
and install the library, which can be obtained from https://github.com/pmem/syscall_intercept

Lastly, libmadvisetest uses the rdtscp instruction by default to perform timekeeping, but
if built with the RDTSC option, will use the non-serialized rdtsc instruction instead.
Ex: $ make RDTSC=1

The included test program (test.c) allocates memory via MMAP system call, uses this memory,
then calls madvise with the MADV_DONTNEED flag. This test utility can be used to verify the
proper functioning of the libmadvisetest library.
